### Canvas Implementation with SQL, LINQ, and .NET Maui

This project presents a sophisticated implementation of database similar to `Canvas`, leveraging the capabilities of `MariaDB`, `LINQ`, and the `.NET Maui` framework. Tailored to meet the diverse needs of its user base, the platform supports the **creation of individualized profiles** for Students, Professors, and Administrators. Each user is distinguished by a **unique ID** and is endowed with **specific privileges** relevant to their role:
|         |
|---------|
- Administrators have the authority to add or modify courses.
- Professors can introduce or adjust assignments.
- Students possess the functionality to upload submissions.
|---------|

The system not only exhibits resilience and stability through rigorous testing but is also optimized for scalability. Additionally, this Canvas implementation is containerized using Docker, ensuring seamless deployment, enhanced security, and streamlined infrastructure management.
