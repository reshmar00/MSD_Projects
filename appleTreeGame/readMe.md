Collaborated with one project partner to create a simple game using C++ and the SFML library for its GUI components. We created several objects on screen (including one that was created dynamically), with some of them interacting with one another, and enabled user interaction through the keyboard. 

The objective of the game is to catch falling apples from a tree in a basket, while a squirrel occassionaly appears and tries to interfere. If the squirrel touches the basket, the game restarts. The user can thwart the squirrel by throwing an apple at it. The LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys control the movement of the basket whereas the SPACEBAR throws an apple at the squirrel.
