Collaborated with one project partner to concieve a simple game that a fulfills the following goals:

• Must have several objects on-screen
• Interaction
  • Objects –You must have at least two separate objects.
    • At least 2 objects must interact with each other in some way
  • User –You must allow the user to interact with your game in some way 
through the keyboard or mouse
• Must create at least one object dynamically

Game synopsis:

In our game, apples fall from a tree and the objective is to catch them in a basket. From time to time, a squirrel might appear and try to interfere with this. If the squirrel touches the basket, the game restarts. You can thwart the squirrel by throwing an apple at it. Use the LEFT and RIGHT arrows to control the movement of the basket and SPACEBAR to throw an apple at the squirrel.
