Collaborated with a project partner to develop an `interactive data visualization` platform using the `D3 library`. Our platform features two interconnected views, each highlighting unique data attributes. Interactions in one view dynamically reflect in the other, offering users an enriched data perspective. User engagement is heightened with functionalities like selection and panning on both the graph and other visual aid. Anchored in `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`, the `D3 library` empowers our platform, facilitating detailed data visualizations complemented by smooth animations.
